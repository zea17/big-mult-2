# Arbitrary Precision Multiply by two

 This was an exercise in our class to come up with an algorithm to multiply a number of arbitrary precision by two. for the sake of exercise the number of digits is limited by a hundred witch you can change in the source code.

 ## How to run

To run this program you have to have GCC or CLang+LLVM installed and then perform the following command to run the code:

 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/zea17/big-mult-2.git
 cd big-mult-2
 g++ -o mult2 ./main.cpp
 ./mult2
 ```
